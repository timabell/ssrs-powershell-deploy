## Installation

### PowerShell Gallery

Install the [SSRS module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SSRS/)
from [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/):

Make sure you have PowerShell Gallery installed (instructions on their
homepage). It's already available in Windows 10.

In an elevated powershell console run:

	Install-Module -Name SSRS

Say `y` to installing from untrusted. Then close the elevated console and you
will now have the `Publish-SSRSProject`/`Solution` commands available in all
your powershell sessions.

If you can't use the gallery for some reason then you can do a manual install
from a download:

### Manual install

1. Download the .zip from
	 https://github.com/timabell/ssrs-powershell-deploy/releases/latest
2. Right-click the zip file in windows explorer, click "properties", and then
	 click "Unblock".
3. Create folder `Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\`
4. Open up the zip file, copy the SSRS folder, paste it into
	 `Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\`. (Or somewhere on your
	 `$env:PSModulePath`)

## Usage

	Publish-SSRSProject.ps1 -path YourReportsProject.rptproj -configuration Release -verbose

You can either specifiy a build configuration to read from the project file, or
you can specify all the information required to publish in the rest of the
parameters.

	Publish-SSRSProject [-Path] <string> [[-Configuration]
		<string>] [[-ServerUrl] <string>] [[-Folder] <string>]
		[[-DataSourceFolder] <string>] [[-DataSetFolder] <string>]
		[[-OutputPath] <string>] 
		[[-OverwriteDataSources] <bool>] [[-OverwriteDatasets] <bool>] 
		[[-Credential] <pscredential>] [-CustomAuthentication]
		[<CommonParameters>]

## Example reports

To open the Example-Reports project in Visual Studio you'll need [Sql Server
Data Tools (SSDT)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt204009.aspx)

## General SSRS gotchas

Disappearing dataset panel -
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7960824/i-lost-datasets-pane-in-visual-studio/28883272#28883272

VS report projects cache both datasets and data. Remove all the `.data` files and the
`bin/` folder(s) to be sure your changes will work when published.
